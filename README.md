# facemaskdetect -face mask detection system
**This is a face mask detection system prototype created using concolutional neural networks(CNN),Keras,python ,tensorflow and opencv.
After further modification this prototype can be used to get connected with CCTV's and used for realtime face mask detections and better implementation of face masks during pandemic.**

**Thanks tothe amazing dataset by Prajna Bhandari consisting of 1376 images with and without masks using which this prototye has been implemented**
